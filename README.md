This is DesignerGPT, a project made by Rochan Madhusudhana and Zach Perlman for CSE 8803-DLT, Deep Learning for Text Data during the Fall 2023 semester at Georgia Tech. This project tests a strategy for improving performing of Large Language Models (LLMs) at design-based tasks, and the use-case we focus on is web design. Specifically, we use GPT-4 as our model, and incorporate the AutoGen framework to create multiple specialized agents that have their own specific role in the overall design process. We observe improved performance via more useful, fleshed-out webpages.
