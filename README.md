This is DesignerGPT, a project created by Rochan Madhusudhana and Zach Perlman for CSE 8803-DLT, Deep Learning for Text Data during the Fall 2023 semester at Georgia Tech. This project tests a strategy for improving the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) at design-based tasks (the use-case we focus on is web design). Specifically, we use GPT-4 as our model, and incorporate the AutoGen framework to create multiple specialized agents that have a specific role in the overall design process. These agents communicate with each other to create a better output than a normal GPT-4 workflow. We observe improved performance via more useful, fleshed-out web pages.
